# Abstract

.smaller[
TensorFlow is the most popular deep learning framework, and R users can use the full power of TensorFlow using the `keras` package.  Many resources exist that describe how to train a model and achieve good results.

However, **production deployment introduces many complications**. For example, the architect must design an appropriate architecture (CPU, GPU or TPU) for training as well as scoring.

Production deployment assumes that you can readily **create a pipeline** that includes data pre-processing, model evaluation and re-training, as well as scoring on a production server with a suitable API.

The R packages `tfdatasets`, `tfruns`, `cloudml` and `tfdeploy` provides a solution for **building pipelines, evaluating models, training hyperparameters** at scale and deploying TensorFlow models to a production server.

The `keras` package allows exporting a model to native format that is easy to deploy, but pre-processing on the TensorFlow graph is much faster than pre-processing using R - this is enabled by the `tfdatasets` package.

I illustrate the concepts by an RStudio internal deep network that classifies support tickets using **natural language processing** with recurrent layers. The network is deployed on an instance of RStudio Connect, and informs recommendations on Zendesk ticketing system.

# Challenges of production deployment

---
class: rstudio-slide

## Why production fails

* Failing to quantify the busines value

* Inability to get stakeholder buy-in

* Getting stuck in optimising model fit

* Failing to close the end-to-end loop

* Lack of change management

## The business problem

Goal:

* Predict which support tickets will be "complex"
* Complexity is the number of back-and-forth comments in the ticket
* High complexity can also be a leading indicator of troubled accounts

Business value:

* Intervene early in complex tickets
* For example by scheduling a phone call with the customer

## Getting stakeholder buy-in

Stakeholder buy-in is critical to the success of your project.

The data science team must work **with** the stakeholders:

* Users
* Management
* IT teams

## plumber APIs

The `plumber` package converts your script into an API using simple decorators in the comments

```r
#* @apiTitle TensorFlow zendesk ticket scoring API

#* Predicts ticket complexity given the initial issue.
#*
#* @param org Ticket organization name
#* @param description Ticket description (text)
#* @param title Ticket title
#* @param id Ticket id
#* 
#* @post /
function(id, title, description, org) {
  score <- runif(1) # <<
  record_in_googlesheet(id, title, description, org, score)
  score
}
```
